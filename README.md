# Data Split

The first 2935 sentences (65764 tokens) are designated as training data.
The next   465 sentences (10099 tokens) are designated as development data.
The final  491 sentences (10891 tokens) are designated as test data.

WARNING: At present, the data cannot be split in a way that is compatible with
the data split of the partially parallel Croatian UD treebank. This poses a
problem for evaluation of any tools that are trained on Croatian and applied
to Serbian.
